# Enhanced-Security-Approach-for-Online-User-Authentication

This is my Bachelor of Engineering - Final Project.
Please Go through the Presentation and Report for details and working screenshots.

Problem Statement

To create an application that will run on android based devices. Its pri-
mary purpose would be to make use of QR code for banking transaction.
It would be consisting of three modules, QR code generation and scanning,
AES encryption module and communication module. Two phase of System
Registration phase and login phase. Firstly user will open the websites login
page and will enter user ID and is sent to server. Output QR code is gen-
erated and displayed, user scans the QR code using android application and
the generated QR code is sent to untrusted system.

Goals and Objectives:

 The main objective and motivation of this project is to eliminate the use
of alpha numeric passwords in online banking transaction by making
use of random QR code generation. The final scenario would be that
a person or a firm would be able to do the transaction which would be
secure from dfferent cyber-attacks like phishing. The user would be
able to do the transaction using untrusted system.
 We aim to have three modules that will be the main functioning units
of the application. First would be the QR code generation and scan-
ning module then AES encryption module and a final communication
module. There will be two phase of a System Registration phase and
login phase.

 At the end, user would be able to use the android application and a
website to do an online banking transaction which will be safe from
cyber-attacks. Mainly this will be helpful for a huge and complete
secure transaction.

Statement of scope

 Quick Response (QR) codes are two dimensional barcodes that can be
used to efficiently store small amount of data. They are increasingly
used in all life fields, especially with the wide spread of smart phones
which are used as QR code scanners. While QR codes have many
advantages that make them very popular, there are several security
issues and risks that are associated with them. Running malicious
code, stealing users sensitive information and violating their privacy
and identity theft are some typical security risks that a user might be
subject to in the background while he/she is just reading the QR code
in the foreground. In this project, a security system for QR codes that
guarantees both users and generators security concerns is implemented.
The system is backward compatible with the current standard used for
encoding QR codes. The system is implemented and tested using an
Android-based smartphone application. It was found that the system
introduces a little overhead in terms of the delay required for integrity
verification and content validation.

Major Constraints

 Login time required may vary.
 Smartphone is required.

Methodologies of Problem solving and efficiency issues

 In this project the basic requirement is an un-trusted pc and android
application for performing the required tasks
 There are two phases in the project:

1. Registration phases
2. Login phase


 The project executes in the following manner:

1. The user first registers itself to the bank server with credentials
name, phone number, username, IMEI number and the password. In
this way the user gets registered in the bank database.
2. In the login phase, the user logins to the website
3. After the user logs in, a QR code is generated on the website.
4. The android application is used for the scanning of QR code. After
scanning we get the username, random number and IMEI number.
5. The password is entered on the android application and all the
details are encrypted and the QR code is generated again on the appli-
cation.
6. The newly generated application is then sent to the bank server for
transaction purpose.
7. The bank server then verifies the received QR code with the bank
server and then grants the user access to the system.
8. Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm is used for the
encryption purpose.

Outcome

 User would be able to use the android application and a website to do
an online banking transaction which will be safe from cyber-attacks.
Mainly this will be helpful for a huge and complete secure transaction.
